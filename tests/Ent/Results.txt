BB512B RSW - 128 MB bitstream file
----------------------------------

>ent -b BB512.32
Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 0.48, and randomly
would exceed this value 49.03 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5000 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141828643 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000005 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
